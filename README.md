# 👋 Hi, I'm **Shreyal Sharma**

![Profile Banner](https://img.shields.io/badge/Welcome–to%20my%20GitHub%20Profile-blue)

I am Shreyal, an undergrad student at NJIT. I am also a developer who enjoys exploring software engineering, machine learning, and app development.

When an idea pops into my head, chances are I will build it. 
I’m a fast learner with a strong focus on full-stack development. My primary tech stack includes Python and Node.js for backend development, and React with JavaScript for building modern, responsive frontends

My favorite planning tools are my iPad for raw ideas, a sheep plush for rubber-duck debugging, and Figma for designing and prototyping.

I have got few pinned projects, but my favorite is [NeverSnooze](https://github.com/Group4And102/NeverSnooze).

Recently, I placed 3rd at the Pfizer Digital Hackathon and have participated in many other hackathons, earning multiple wins along the way. 

## Fun facts
I love cats!
I am learning animation using procreate.
My hobbies include painting, playing badminton, and reading.
